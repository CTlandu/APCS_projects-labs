# APCS_projects-labs
Contains most projects' codes of the book Fundamentals_of_Java-Kenneth_Lambert_Martin_Osborne &amp; AP Computer Science's Labs

@author: Colin(Jizhou) Tang

As a student who studied AP Computer Science at school, my initial purpose of creating this respiratory is to conserve those codes I wrote for the courses, which will be convinient if I want to review later. But those who feel difficult to finish the same projects as me may benefit by looking at parts of these codes. But please don't just copy all of them. Remember, learning programming needs self-thinking. 

Hope you do well in your course :) Have a nice day.

# These codes may not contain the best and concise algorithms. Because I am still a high school student, my coding ability is limited.
# But, if you think that some codes really need to be modified, please feel free to tell me! Thanks a lot.
